### Testing task 2 code:

# Carry out dynamic testing on the code below.
# Correct the errors below that you spotted in task 1.

require_relative('card.rb')
class CardGame


  def checkforAce(card)
    if card.value = 1
      return true
    else
      return false
    end
  end

 # method should be names check_for_ave as convention
 # should be == rather than =


  dif highest_card(card1 card2)
  if card1.value > card2.value
    return card.name
  else
    card2
  end
end
end

# code should be indented properly
# def instead of 'dif'
# should use a comma between card1 and card2 arguments
# card does not have an attribute of .name
# should have 'return card2' instead of just card2
# extra unneccesary end

def self.cards_total(cards)
  total
  for card in cards
    total += card.value
    return "You have a total of" + total
  end
end

# total should be initialized, should be total = 0
# the string return should be after the end of the for loop
#
# class has no 'end'
